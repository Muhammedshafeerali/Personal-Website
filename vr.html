                                Researchers from Northwestern University have developed a prototype device which aims to
                                put touch within VR’s reach, using a flexible material fitted with tiny vibrating
                                components that can be attached to skin.

                                The system, known as epidermal VR, could be useful in other cases as well, from a child
                                touching a display relaying the gesture to a family member located elsewhere, to helping
                                people with amputations renew their sense of touch.

                                In gaming, it could alert players when a strike occurs on the corresponding body part of
                                the game character.

                                The team’s design features 32 vibrating actuators on a thin 15cm by 15cm silicone polymer which sticks on to the skin without tape or straps and is free of large batteries and wires.

                                It uses near-field communication (NFC) technology – which is used in many smartphones for mobile payment today – to transfer the data.
                                
                                “The result is a thin, lightweight system that can be worn and used without constraint indefinitely,” says Professor John A Rogers, who worked on the project.
                                
                                Scientists hope that the technology could eventually find its way into clothing, allowing people with prosthetics to wear VR shirts that communicate touch through their fingertips.
