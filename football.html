                                There are many kind of game in our country. Of all games, I like football most. It was
                                first played in England. Now it is played in all countries of the world. Why
                                Favourite/Why you like it: Football is my Favourite game. Because it has some
                                advantages. It is not as costly as cricket. It gives us much pleasure. It is an exiting
                                game. It thrills both the players and the spectators. 

                                Description: Football is an outdoor game. It requires a big field. It 120 yards long and
                                80 yards wide. There are two goal posts at each end. The game is played between two
                                teams. Each team has eleven players. Of them one is goalkeeper, two full backs, three
                                half backs and five forwards. There is a referee to conduct the game. How played: At the
                                beginning of the ball is placed at the centre on the field. The referee whistles and the
                                game begin. Then each team tricks to pass the ball through the opposite goal post. But
                                they cannot touch the ball with hands. Only the goalkeeper can touch and catch it. There
                                is an interval of 10 minutes. The sides are changed after the interval. The team which
                                scores more goals wins the game. Merits/Usefulness/Advantages: The game of football
                                teaches us obedience to rules. It also teaches discipline. Co-operation and leadership.
                                It improves the health of a player and makes him prompt. Careful strong and hardy. 

                                Conclusion: Though the game of football has some risks of being injured. It is liked by
                                all.
