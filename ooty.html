                                Just 10 km away from the Ooty hill station in Coonoor, Dolphin’s Nose is a popular viewpoint of the region that offers a lovely view of the Catherine Falls. This viewpoint is perched at an altitude of over 1000 feet above the sea level.
                                 The viewpoint has been named so, as the unique rock formation resembles the shape of the nose of a dolphin. Sunset and Sunrise views from here are memorable. While going to towards Dolphin’s Nose from Ooty, Lamb’s nose is another viewpoint that comes in the way.
                                  The road journey is an extremely beautiful one but with hairpin turns.
                                 Treat your eyes to the lovely views of the lush plantations.
