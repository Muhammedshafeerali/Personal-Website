                            <h3>Web App Development:</h3>


                            <p class="text-justify pt-4 " style="line-height: 1cm;">
                                Web application development is the process and practice of developing web applications.
                                There is a consensus that the processes involved are extensions of standard software
                                engineering processes. Considering this, along with its unique characteristics, popular
                                frameworks used include the spiral approach and business-oriented approach to
                                application development, among other models that address the requirements for an
                                iterative process.

                                Just as with a traditional desktop application, the website development company brings
                                web applications which have varying levels of risk. A personal home page is much less
                                risky than, for example, a stock trading web site. For some projects security, software
                                bugs, etc. are major issues. If time to market, or technical complexity is a concern,
                                documentation, test planning, change control, requirements analysis, architectural
                                description and formal design and construction practices can mitigate risk.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Python Web Development:</h3>


                            <p>
                                Python can be used to build server-side web applications. While a web framework is not required to build web apps, it's rare that developers would not use existing open source libraries to speed up their progress in getting their application working.

                               Python is not used in a web browser. The language executed in browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer is JavaScript. Projects such as pyjs can compile from Python to JavaScript. However, most hired Python developers write their web applications using a combination of Python and JavaScript. 
                               Python is executed on the server side while JavaScript is downloaded to the client and run by the web browser.
