                                    Sports are good for any nation. Various games are played in India. India has
                                    excelled in few games and failed in various other games. Our individual performances
                                    are outstanding in some games but lack of team work can be seen at various sports.
                                    Proper sports policy could have helped in doing better performances at Olympics and
                                    Asiads. Poor performances are also due to lack of infrastructural facilities. In the
                                    last 50 years, the government’s role has not been quire upto the mark. A country of
                                    90 crore people fails miserably at important world sports events like World Cups,
                                    Olympics, Asiads, etc.

                                    In hockey, India had Dhyanchand popularly known as hockey wizard and late K.D. Singh
                                    Baby who brought laurels to the country by winning hockey golds at Olympics. But we
                                    could nor prolong their legacies of performing the best. Later on India fell far
                                    behind because it emphasized on dribbling. Throughout the field the game was
                                    excellent but when it came to scoring a goal, it used to remain a distant reality.
                                    The grounds in subsequent years became technologically improved like Astro turf. It
                                    took India a lot of time to catch up on these grounds due to lack of infrastructure
                                    and such grounds on home. Moreover, killer instinct to score a goal was also lacking
                                    on various occasions. That is why Germany, Australia and even Pakistan are able to
                                    perform better than India. Similar is the condition with football, the most popular
                                    game. India’s performance is so dismal that we are not even able to qualify for the
                                    World Cup Soccer Tournaments held every four years.

                                    In athletics again, India’s performance has been poor. The largest team goes to the
                                    Olympics and comes without winning any medal. In the last fifty years India had not
                                    got any gold medal. In 1984, P.T. Usha, the sprint queen remained away from winning
                                    a bronze medal in hurdles race by fraction of a second, though she did outstanding
                                    performance by winning few golds at Asiads. We also had good performance by Milkha
                                    Singh, the flying Sikh of India. Again we are lacking in Javelin and Discus throws.
                                    Limba Ram showed outstanding performances at Archery championship but he is not
                                    consistent.



                                    The reasons for poor performance can be attributed to the non-availability of
                                    economic support to these sports persons. The conditions of some of our outstanding
                                    performers have been very depressing due to poverty. They were not given enough
                                    economic support to live a good life. This kills the motivation at the entry level
                                    to play and later on to excel. There has to be a support so that the players do not
                                    drop out when they are needed the most. Of course, the proper training and proper
                                    nutritions have to be provided at every level but they are not. Some improvements as
                                    regards to policies have been formulated as now they are suitably rewarded. But lot
                                    can be done. Various awards are given to outstanding sports persons like Arjun
                                    awards and Dronacharya awards to the coaches.
