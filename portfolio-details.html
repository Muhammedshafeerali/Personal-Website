              Mumbai, previously known as Bombay, is the most populous and one of the biggest cities in India.
               Called the city of dreams, Mumbai is not only the powerhouse of Indian business, industry and 
               trade but also the financial and entertainment capital of the country. It is the perfect blend 
               of modernity and tradition, and you’ll see people from all walks of life here. It is no exaggeration
                to call Mumbai the ‘New York City’ of India — the character and vibe of Mumbai is unlike any other.

              Having lived here for three years now, these are my top recommendations for anyone who is visiting Mumbai.

            <p class="text-justify pt-1 " style="line-height: 1cm;">
              South Bombay, which is basically old Mumbai, boasts of some incredible architecture 
              that is a mix of Gothic and contemporary styles. Taking a walk around Fort and Colaba 
              will make you feel like you’re transported back in time and the British influence on buildings 
              is very evident from the colonial era. Whether you’re walking and exploring on your own or are on 
              a heritage tour, Mumbai’s colonial-era buildings are worth witnessing. One building that particularly 
              stands out is the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, which is the main railway station in Mumbai and is indeed an architectural wonder.

            <p class="text-justify pt-1 " style="line-height: 1cm;">
              The Gateway of India is an arch monument built during the 20th century in Bombay, India. The monument was
               erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder on their visit to India in 1911.

            Built in Indo-Saracenic style, the foundation stone for the Gateway of India was laid on 31 March 1911. The structure is an arch made
            of basalt, 26 metres (85 feet) high. The final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924. The Gateway was later used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay.  It served to allow entry and access to India.

           The Gateway of India is located on the waterfront at Apollo Bunder area at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea. The monument has also been referred to as the Taj Mahal of Mumbai, and is the city’s top tourist attraction.

            <p class="text-justify pt-1 " style="line-height: 1cm;">
              There are various promenades in Mumbai where you can just sit, relax and enjoy the sea breeze and the magnificent views. 
              Marine Drive is the most popular promenade and is one of Mumbai’s star attractions. If you’re visiting Mumbai, walking along 
              Marine Drive, and watching the sunset as you sit on the ledge with your feet dangling should be a must-do on your list. 
              The ambience here is charming and intoxicating, and you can easily spend a few hours here. On one end of Marine Drive is 
              the Girgaum Chowpatty, which is one of Bombay’s famous beaches where you can also find some incredible local Indian street 
              food. Other famous promenades in Mumbai include Carter Road and Bandstand in the lush suburbs of Bandra.

            <h2 class="text-center pt-4"><b>Take a Day Trip to Elephanta Caves</b></h2>
            <img src="/assets/img/portfolio/cave2.jpg" alt=""class="rounded mx-auto d-block w-100">
            <p class="text-justify pt-1 " style="line-height: 1cm;">
              Elephanta Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, are a network of caves sculpted from basalt rock 
              on Elephanta Island, which is an hour-long ferry ride from Gateway of India. 
              The ferry ride offers some great views of Mumbai’s coastline, and it takes about 4 hours to 
              visit the island and the caves. The caves are rich in history and are known to be from the 6th 
              or 8th century. During my visit, I hired a tour guide, who took us through the caves and narrated 
              the story of how the caves came into being.

            <p class="text-justify pt-1 " style="line-height: 1cm;">
              Bandra, the ‘Queen of Suburbs’, is the hipster suburb of Mumbai and has a very laid back vibe to it.
               A locality that houses some of the most popular Bollywood stars, it also has some of the cutest cafes 
               and restaurants. The beautiful Mount Mary Church overlooking the Arabian Sea is visited by plenty of 
               locals and tourists, and the elegant Gothic architecture of the church makes it worth seeing. If you’re 
               someone who enjoys street art and graffiti, take a walk down Chapel Road to see some fascinating wall art. 
               The sunsets in Mumbai are very dramatic, and Bandra has two incredible spots to witness the sunset: Carter Road and Bandstand.

            <h2 class="text-center pt-4"><b>Indulge your taste buds</b></h2>
            <img src="/assets/img/portfolio/food.jpg" alt="" class="rounded mx-auto d-block w-100">
            <p class="text-justify pt-1 ">
              If you’re in the mood to tantalise your taste buds, you’ll absolutely love Mumbai.
               The food here is as diverse as the people, ranging from street food to fine dining. 
               The street food here has a distinct taste and flavour as compared to other cities in India.
               Some items you must try are pav bhaji, vada pav, bhel puri, and my favourite – pani puri. 
              While you’re here, you should also try out authentic Iranian cuisine at a Parsi café (I highly recommend Kayani & Co., and Brittania & Company Restaurant).
               The most clichéd restaurant for a tourist to visit in Bombay is Leopold Café. It’s been around since 1871 and has gotten popular because of its’ mention in the book Shantaram.
                 You could also indulge in some Mughlai cuisine at Punjab Grill. There are myriad options for dessert but one joint that is very popular in Mumbai is Natural Ice cream, which serves natural fruit ice creams, and you’ll find a branch in almost every area in Bombay.

            <p class="text-justify pt-1 ">The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, formerly known as Victoria Terminus Station, in Mumbai, is an outstanding example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture in India, blended with themes deriving from Indian traditional architecture. The building, designed by the British architect F. W. Stevens, became the symbol of Bombay as the ‘Gothic City’ and the major international mercantile port of India. The terminal was built over 10 years, starting in 1878, according to a High Victorian Gothic design based on late medieval Italian models. Its remarkable stone dome, turrets, pointed arches and eccentric ground plan are close to traditional Indian palace architecture. 
              It is an outstanding example of the meeting of two cultures, as British architects worked with Indian craftsmen to include Indian architectural tradition and idioms thus forging a new style unique 
              to Bombay.</p>
              <p class="text-justify pt-1 ">There’s so much more to see and do in Mumbai, and if you have the time to, you should definitely explore this beautiful city on your own.</p>
